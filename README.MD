# WordPress Starter Plugin
### A great framework that makes WordPress plugin development easier!

---
Before creating your first **WPSP** project, make sure you have the following applications installed on your local computer:

- PHP: **8.x**
- PHP CLI: **8.x**
- Composer
- Nodejs
- A website WordPress (A) running on Localhost with version 5.6 or higher

<blockquote>
Please pay attention to whether the PHP version and PHP CLI running are suitable for the project WPSP will develop or not?!
</blockquote>

After installing the above applications, go to the directory: `/wp-content/plugins` of the Website (A) to initialize a new WPSP project via the following Composer command:

<pre>
composer create-project oceancodex/wpsp my-new-plugin
</pre>

The plugin project with the folder name `my-new-plugin` will be initialized and the dependencies will be downloaded.

Then, run the commands below to install the complete project:

<pre>
cd my-new-plugin
</pre>

<pre>
php bin/install
</pre>

The installer will ask you for some project information, fill in that information like the following example:

- **Project name:** Project name `(eg: My New Plugin)`
- **Project short name:** Short project name `(eg: mnp)`
- **Root namespace:** Namespace of the project `(eg: MyNewPlugin)`
- **Prefix for environment key:** Prefix for variables in the .env file `(eg: MNP_)`
- **Prefix for database table:** Prefix for the names of the project tables in the database `(e.g. mnp_)`
- **Prefix for helper functions:** Prefix for functions in the Helpers file `(eg: mnp_)`
- **Prefix for cache key:** Prefix for cache keys `(eg: mnp-cache)`
- **Text domain:** Text domain used for translation according to WordPress standards `(eg: my-new-plugin)`

<blockquote>
The above information must be declared correctly in writing style, uppercase and lowercase as in the example for the project to work best.
<br/><br/>
Declare the above information to limit plugin conflicts and create an independent operating environment for each project using WPSP running on the same website.
</blockquote>

The installer will automatically set up the project, installing dependencies.

If not, you can manually run the following commands to complete project setup:

<pre>
composer update
</pre>

<pre>
npm install
</pre>

<pre>
npm run mix-production
</pre>

That's it, you've completed setting up a new plugin project based on WPSP.

Go to the Plugins menu in `/wp-admin` to activate your: `My New Plugin` plugin.
